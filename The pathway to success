# Assess the situation:
1. What are the stats of the df? .describe , .length

#Problems with the df
1.Missing values
1.1 Different formats: time, different formulations of the same variable
1.2 Categorical vars? Convert categorical into numerical, or hot-encoded
1.3 

#Model selection
3.0 Run a basic linear reg/classification
3.1 View a correlation for variables to y, docs in 'pre-processing'
3.2 Determine the model to use next:
predict 1 or 0: 
SVM, 
K-neighbour, 
Gaussian Naive Bayes, 
perceptron - linear classifier (0,1)
Linear SVC
Stochastic Gradient Descent
Decision Tree
Random Tree
